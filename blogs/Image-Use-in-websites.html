    <h1>Image Use in websites</h1>

    <p>When I started creating basic Html and CSS websites, I didn't pay much attention to small things which had a crucial role in websites;
        Images. 
        <br/><br/>
        During practice, I used to pick any picture I want from the internet and put it on my website as it was for my personal use and not for any commercial use. But when I started doing internships and freelancing, I got to know about copyright issues. We can't take any image you want from the internet for commercial purposes; we must check for copyright. 
        <br/><br/>
        With experience, I can tell two ways you can get no copyright images. </p>
    <h2>1. Google Images</h2>
    <p>When searching for images in google, go in tools and check for usage rights, you will see two options, <br/>
        <h3>Creative Commons licenses</h3>
        It is a license issued by the copyright owner to allow anyone in the world to use their copyright work in any manner consistent with that license. <br/>
        <h3>Commercially licensed images</h3>
        Images used with the intent to sell a product, raise money, promote or endorse something. <br/><br/>
        <image id="img1" src="media/google-tools-image.gif"></image><br/><br/>
        If you want to use the image for commercial purposes you should go for a common creative license as it is free to use and without copyright. </p>
    <h2>2. Copyright Free Image Websites</h2>
    <p>Another way to get copyright-free images is to go to listed popular websites: <br/><br/>
